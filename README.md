## 🛠 How It Works: Pure Client-Side Power

This application operates entirely in your browser using **Vanilla JavaScript**.

* **No Server Uploads:** Your text is *never* sent to a server. The conversion is instant and local, ensuring maximum privacy and speed.
* **Unicode Magic:** The styling works by swapping standard Roman letters and numbers (A, B, 1) with their stylized, globally supported Unicode character equivalents (𝐀, 𝗕, 𝟙). The styles are stored in a simple JavaScript object map (`char_maps.js`) which the main script uses for conversion.
* **0Fluff Efficiency:** This approach requires no external APIs or dependencies, keeping the application lightweight and blazing fast.
